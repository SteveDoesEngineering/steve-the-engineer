I found via Perth Machine Learning Group, the fastai course, which is fantastic. . It is primarily the reason for this blog and why I mention it (check out Appendix A and fastpages in github). . . I’m also thinking to record what I know about: . The world of power engineering. | How I get on with investing. | Anything else I find interesting and study. | . This is mainly so that I can point anyone interested to this as a sort of wiki. .",
