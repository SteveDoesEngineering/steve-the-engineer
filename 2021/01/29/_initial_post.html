<p>Hello Folks!</p>

It’s interesting for me this year. This year feels different, in terms of new year’s resolutions.
I think I might actually keep them and write that blog I’ve been meaning to.</p>

<p>Over the past two years, I’ve taken up an interest in Machine Learning and specifically Deep Learning.</p>

<p>It is primarily the reason for this blog and why I mention it (Appendix A).</p>

<p>I’m also thinking to record what I know about the world of Power.</p>

<p>I’m also thinking to record what I know about:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The world of power engineering.</li>
  <li>How I get on with my investment journey.</li>
  <li>Anything else I find interesting and study.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is mainly so that I can point my colleagues or new persons to this as a sort of wiki.</p>

<p>We’ll see.</p>
