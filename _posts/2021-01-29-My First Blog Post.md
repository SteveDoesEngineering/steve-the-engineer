# My First Blog

Hello Folks!

It's interesting, this year feels different in terms of new year's resolutions.
I think I might actually keep them.
It's interesting for me this year. This year feels different, in terms of new year's resolutions.
I think I might actually keep them and write that blog I've been meaning to.

Over the past two years, I've taken up an interest in Machine Learning and specifically Deep Learning. 

It is primarily the reason for this blog and why I mention it (Appendix A).

I'm also thinking to record what I know about the world of Power.

I'm also thinking to record what I know about:
 - The world of power engineering.
 - How I get on with my investment journey.
 - Anything else I find interesting and study.
 
This is mainly so that I can point my colleagues or new persons to this as a sort of wiki.

We'll see.
