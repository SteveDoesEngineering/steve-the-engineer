# My First Blog

Hello Folks!

Over the past two years, I've taken up an interest in Machine Learning and specifically Deep Learning.
I found via Perth Machine Learning Group, the fastai course, which is fantastic. 

It is primarily the reason for this blog and why I mention it (check out Appendix A and fastpages in github).

I'm also thinking to record what I know about:
 - The world of power engineering.
 - How I get on with investing.
 - Anything else I find interesting and study.
 
This is mainly so that I can point anyone interested to this as a sort of wiki.
